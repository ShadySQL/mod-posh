# Welcome #
This is a collection of scripts that I use on a daily basis. Feel free to [browse](https://code.google.com/p/mod-posh/source/browse/powershell/production) the source, I would consider the code Public Domain as a large portion of it came from articles I read on [Technet](http://technet.microsoft.com) and other IT related sites. If you have any questions, please feel free to [contact me](mailto:jspatton1971@gmail.com).

Here are other places you can find code from me:

# Structure #
There are two scripting technologies that I'm working in, Visual Basic Scripting Edition and PowerShell. I feel comfortable in saying that I'm very proficient in getting VBScript to do what I want, but it's older tech that is slowly fading away. PowerShell is the new scripting technology and I'm starting to learn how to code in it, and how to adapt what I have to PowerShell.
## Playground ##
The playground is where you will find snippets of code and half-formed ideas. I usually will start out here, and once the code does what I want I clean it up. Usually this entails clearing out the stubs, adding comments, error-handling and white-space/indentation to make the code easier to read and understand.
## Production ##
This is where the fully realized script lives. The idea that you could copy the script from this location and it just runs wherever you paste it into.
